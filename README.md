# Lucidchart 
My expericence with the Lucid chart is very minimal although today I got the opportunity use it. I can tell this is a very useful tool to help a wide variety of professionals. It seems to very simple to use but I beleive you have to have a strong idea as to what you actually want to create but the templates will give you some ideas as to where you may want to go with your vision. I do like the fact that there are plenty of templates to choose from also.
# Introduction to Networking 
Data Transmission
1.Protocol-Set of rules to allow devices to communicate.

2. Packet- Unit of data.

 3.Packet-Switching- Technology that allows packets of data to be routed based on destination address.
 .4IP Address- Unique identifying number.
 
 5.DNS- Directory of IP address common names.  For example 54.239.26.214 might be the IP address of amazon.com
 
6.All of these terms are used to comminucate with internet in some way.

## Networking Hardware
A. The benefit of a switch over a hub is that a switch is considered to be intellegent it has multi ports, it can learn and keep record of MAC addresses and it can also detect certain devices that are connected to it compared to a Hub.
B.The benefit of a router is that they are used to connect to networks while Hubs and Switches connect to LAN'S. They have the ability to read IP addresses while switches and hubs can't. Routers have the ability to reject information if it's not intended for their network as well.
Network Topologies
A. A single ponit of failure is part of a system where if it fails the entire network will stop or go down. The Topology that experiences this is call a Star Topology.
B.Infrastructure Topology and Wireless Mesh are differnt in many ways one for instance is the with a wireless mesh there's less cabling  and if one network looses it's access point or fails it will re route it to the nearest data center. I think that the wireless mess is better becuase of the fact there's less cabling that makes it easier to place routers in locations where they can't be seen.
Network Design- My design was a simple network which consited of two computers, printer, router and a wirless access point.
NSA/CSS- The role of the NSA/CSS is to protect and defend National Security systems. It includes networks that contain classified information and other forms of intllegence imnportatnat to the military or Govenment agencies. The NSA runs 24/7 cybersecurity watching for threats and creating defensive measures for National Security Systems.
#Cybersecurity and Encryption
Information Systems Security
A. If I was an employee for Amazon.com the security Triad would be an integral part of my job. When dealing with customers confidentiality would be on of the top processes I'd use.I'd have to verify if the individual I'm in contact with is actually who they say they are to make sure they are allowed to have access to the information. When it comes to Integrity I'd have to make sure i fthey wanted to make changes to an order for example that they were approved to do so. Also my integrity as an employees would haveto be trusted as well to perform the correct task. As for availabilty en example of this would be that their servers are available 24 hours a day for cusotmers to have access to the site.
B. Three daily thask that would involve authentication would be logging into an email account, using your Debit Card to make a purchase at the grocery store or possibly logging into your cellphone. Theses three daily activies require authentication but can be convert to as an multi-factor authentication to make sure your inforamtion never falls into the wrong hands. For example the Iphone XR has facial recognition and a passsword to verify you're the actual owner of the phone with the debit card if they suspect you're not the true owner of the card they will send you a text message to verify if it's you using it and with the email if you fail to enter in the correct inforamtion they may ask for another email or phone number to verify as well.
C. ACL stands for Access Control List and RBAC stands for role based control.The advantage of an ACL is that it's easy and simple to maintain but the disadvantage is that each information resouces is maintained separately . With RBC user are assigned certain roles and then asssigned access it makes it easier for individuals to mange certain parts of a process.
D. Ciphertext is the communication channnel between public and private keys it keeps the code hidden until it gets to the private key user to decipher the code. A public key can be sent ot anyone with a message but a private key is used to secure the true message.
E. We need public key cryptography to cerain things secure like money at banks or with govenment agencies it keeps things hidden until it get to the true recipient.
#Cybersecurity and Encryption. 
Cryptography
The encryption that I chose was hello world as I rotated the wheel the message was changed to several differnt letters that didn't resemble the orignal message I chose. After rotating it the message looked something like this yvccf nficu which is totally diffent from the original message.
C. As I began to type I noticed that if I typed a letter more than once the bar went up higher indicating how many times I typed the word.
D. A Polyalphabetic cipher is a mixed alphabet used to encrypt plain text.
E. As I began to type the message i want to win in the box it changed he message completly in the shift box. I notice in the shift box as well is that there arren't any spaces between each word also.
Brute-Force
Brute force tries to attack every possible decryption key for the cipher. The Kerckhoffs's principal beleives that even though the code is known it should still be hidden or secure.
